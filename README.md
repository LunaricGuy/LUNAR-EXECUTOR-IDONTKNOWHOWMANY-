Lunar is a Universal Script that supports every experience!

Open/Run " executor_LUNARV2 " or " executor_LUNARV2.exe " It's one of those 2 I guess
If it does not work you might need Python 3.1.1 or +

AND IF IT STILL DOES NOT WORK, Open Command Prompt then write

cd Desktop *enter*
cd Lunar Executor *enter* (Name of the executor's File)
python executor_LUNARV2.exe *enter* (Name of the executor) if you rename the executor you should still type ".exe" at the end

I keep making Repositorys because Github won't let me Update1!11!!

I tried fixing some bugs since the customers didn't find it working.
